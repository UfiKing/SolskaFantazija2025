*Title:** *The Stolen Broom of Bel Vrh pod Idrijo*

**Setting:** The adventure takes place in the small, misty town of *Bel Vrh pod Idrijo*, nestled deep in a forested valley. The town is peaceful, though locals are wary of the surrounding wilderness.

### **Part 1: Arrival in Bel Vrh pod Idrijo**

The adventurers arrive in town, perhaps seeking rest or responding to rumors of a mysterious theft. As they explore the cobbled streets, they are approached (or overhear) a grumpy old man named **Gregor**, a local alchemist and retired adventurer.

Gregor is furious—someone (or something) has stolen his enchanted broom, along with some potions and a pouch of gold. He demands the adventurers track down the thief. Gregor insists that his broom isn’t just an ordinary cleaning tool—it has minor magical properties, allowing it to hover slightly above the ground.

He offers a small reward but seems reluctant to admit how much the broom meant to him. He does, however, mention strange claw marks near his shed, leading into the dark woods to the west.

### **Part 2: Into the Forest**

Following Gregor’s directions, the players set off into the dense forest. The woods are filled with eerie sounds, shifting shadows, and a growing sense of being watched. As they push deeper in, they come across signs of a struggle—broken branches, clawed tree trunks, and small glass shards from Gregor’s missing potions.

Before they can investigate further, a **pack of bears (2 black bears and 1 brown bear)** ambushes them! The bears, agitated and possibly under the influence of spilled potions, attack ferociously.

> *Combat Encounter: 2x Black Bears (MM pg. 318) + 1x Brown Bear (MM pg. 319)*

After the battle, the players find bear tracks leading further into the forest, accompanied by deep gouges in the ground—suggesting something much larger was involved.

### **Part 3: The Cliffside Discovery**

Following the trail, the party arrives at the edge of a massive cliff. The forest ends abruptly, revealing a steep drop into the misty valley below. As they scan the area, a **shadow looms overhead**—a monstrous creature circles above them, flapping its wings unnaturally.

It’s a **Chimera (weakened for level 3 players)**!

The players quickly realize the monster has *eaten Gregor’s broom*, which is now magically allowing it to fly. The potions it ingested are likely enhancing its aggression, making it even more dangerous.

> *Combat Encounter: Weakened Chimera (Reduce HP, remove one breath weapon use, slightly lower AC)*

The battle takes place on the cliffside, with players needing to strategize against a flying foe. Perhaps they use environmental tactics—throwing rocks, luring it to the ground, or using magic to counter its flight.

---

### **Part 4: Resolution**

Once the chimera is defeated, the players find Gregor’s broom among its remains. The broom is intact but **coated in monster saliva** (Gregor won’t be happy about that). The gold and shattered potion vials are scattered around the battlefield.

Returning to town, Gregor is both relieved and disgusted by the state of his broom. He begrudgingly hands over their promised reward, mumbling about having to *“boil the thing for a week”* to get the monster smell off.

The town cheers for the adventurers, and the mystery of the flying monster is solved!

---

### **Rewards & Experience**
- Gregor offers **25 gold per player** for their trouble.
- Players can recover **one minor magic potion** from the battlefield.
- The town recognizes the adventurers as heroes, offering free lodging for the night.
- XP for encounters (adjusted based on party size and performance).

---

**Possible Twists:**
- Gregor *isn’t* telling the full story—maybe the broom was once part of a failed experiment?
- The chimera wasn’t the *only* creature affected by the potions…
- Someone in town may have orchestrated the theft for their own gain.
